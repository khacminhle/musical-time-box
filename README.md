<h1>Musical Time Box Project</h1>

<h3>Application Idea: </h3>

<p>
  This project was by my struggle to add music manually on my spotify. So I built a script
  that scraps the top 100 songs from the billboard website and then use Spotify API to authenticate
  make a new playlist and automatically add all the songs.
